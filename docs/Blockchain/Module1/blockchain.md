# What is a Blockchain?

- A data structure
- Typically an ordered, back-linked list of blocks with data.
- Each block is identified by a hash
- The hashes protect the integrity of the data

Typically, the blocks in a blockchain contain blockheaders and a payload

Although the payload could be any arbitrary data, it is mainly used for

- Record keeping - who, what, when, and why (ex: ledgers)
- Self-executing code (ex: smart contracts)
- Hashes of arbitrary data (ex: hashes of Images, videos as NFTs)
