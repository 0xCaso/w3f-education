For the past two plus years that Polkadot has been live, there have been questions from the community that frequently present themselves in socials. In this post Iâ€™ll be answering some of those questions. If you have any other questions that you think should be a part of this post, please leave a comment.

## How does staking work?

Staking on {{ polkadot: Polkadot :polkadot }}{{ kusama: Kusama :kusama }} uses Nominated Proof-of-Stake(NPoS), which is a flavor of PoS that allows for two types of participants, nominators and validators. Validators are the entities that run a full version of the Polkadot blockchain as a node, and they secure the network by bonding an amount of tokens, which in turn allows them to create blocks. Nominators are the entities that elect validators into the active validator set, which currently is 297 on Polkadot and 1000 on Kusama.
