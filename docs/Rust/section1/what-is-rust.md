description: An introduction to what the Rust programming language is, and how it compares to other languages.

Rust is a systems programming language that is aimed to empower its users with high-level, ergonomic code whilst also being able to maintain a level of control akin to a language like C.  It's meant to empower and give confidence to whomever is writing it, and guarantee secure and reliable output.

It offers many solutions and unique takes in terms of combining the best of both object-oriented and functional programming concepts into one single language.  Rust is **statically typed**, focuses on code and memory safety, and a powerful memory management system that eliminates the need for a garbage collector.
