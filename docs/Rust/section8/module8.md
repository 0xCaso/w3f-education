# 8. Web Assembly

A little core info about what wasm is and why it is valuable. The rust-wasm toolchain. How to add a target with rustup. How to cross compile to the new target. How to execute a wasm binary from within Rust (this is How the runtime is executed). How to package for the browser - Not directly Substrate related, but very cool, and very useful.
