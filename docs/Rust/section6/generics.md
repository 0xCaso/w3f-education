Generics are a powerful concept that allow for types to be "expected" or known, without knowing what they are.  Previously, you've encountered generics when dealing with the `Option<T>` enum, where `T` is a generic that can accept any type.

Generics can be used in traits, methods, functions, enums, and structs.
