# On-Chain Governance

The relay chain's logic itself will need updating occasionally. The governance mechanism 
allows Polkadot token holders to participate in the decision-making process rather than
having any changes to the system be imposed by a central authority { or in the case of some de-
centralised systems, by a team of developers. Too often, a contentious code change has led existing
blockchains to an impasse or a permanent fork. We want a mechanism that balances being able
to make uncontentious changes quickly when needed, while also providing the tools to deal with
contentious proposals in a decisive and fair manner. The ultimate arbiters of Polkadot are the DOT
token holders and so all important decisions, such as code changes, are made by state-weighted referenda. 
There is an elected council, responsible for making smaller decisions and partially setting
the priority for referenda, in such a way that they cannot block a change that a majority wants.

Polkadot uses sophisticated mechanisms for Governance which allows it to evolve gracefully over
time at the ultimate behest of its assembled stakeholders. A key and unfailing rule is that all
changes to the protocol must be agreed upon by stake-weighted referendum { the majority of
stake always commands the network.
In order to make any changes to the network, the idea is to bring DOT holders together and
administrate a network upgrade decision with the help of the Council (see Section 4.6.2). No
matter whether the proposal is submitted by a DOT holder or by the Council, it will ultimately
have to go through a referendum to let all DOT holders, weighted by stake, make the decision.
Each DOT holder in Polkadot has the right to: a) submit a proposal, b) endorse a public
proposal to prioritise it in the referendum timetable, c) vote on all active referenda, d) become a
candidate for a seat in the Council, and e) vote on candidates for the Council. In addition, any
DOT holder may become a nominator or a validator candidate to participate in NPoS
