# Decentralization of Network

Our decentralisation objective translates into the classical notion of proportional representation in voting theory. That is, a committee should represent each minority in the
electorate proportional to their aggregate vote strength (in this case, their stake), with no minority
being under-represented. We highlight here that nominators { and their lists of trusted candidates
{ constitute a valuable gauge for the preferences of the general community, and that diverse pref-
erences and factions will naturally arise not only due to economical and security-related reasons,
but also political, geographical, etc. Such diversity of points of view is expected and welcome in a
decentralised community, and it is important to engage all minorities in decision-making processes
to ensure user satisfaction.

The goal of designing an electoral system that achieves proportional representation has been
present in the literature for a very long time. Of special note is the work of Scandinavian math-
ematicians Edvard Phragm en and Thorvald Thiele in the late nineteenth century. Very recently,
there has been considerable e ort in the research community to formalise the notion of proportional
representation, and revisit the methods by Phragm en and Thiele and optimise them algorithmi-
cally. Our validator selection protocol is an adaptation of Phragm en's methods and is guaranteed
to observe the technical property of proportional justified representation (PJR)
