In the late 19th century he noticed that the Swedish parliamentary seats were occupied by the most popular political party and that minority parties were not represented. In order to have better voter representation in parliament he designed a method which would distribute votes across seats fairly. This became known as the Phragm\xe9n method, and it works well for elections where there are multiple winners.

Both of these elections have many voters with varying stake, many candidates to elect or nominate, and many available seats in either the validator set or the council. seq-Phragm\xe9n has a property called proportional justified representation(PJR), which makes sure that no one candidate is over or under-represented; it is a method that finds a fair distribution of stake across the highest-backed candidates. By sequentially optimizing the elected set of candidates and the stake distributed across those elected, it gets us closer to ideals that would ensure high security of the network, better representation of token holders in elections, as well as decentralization of validators and council members.
