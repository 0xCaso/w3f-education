We shall cover the topic of on chain indentity in a different video, but know that Polkadot supports that feature. The most recent block number corresponds to the best block number that you see here. A block has to be finalized to become part of the polkadot chain. Block finalisation takes time and hence, the finalized block number always trails behind the best block number. If block finalisation runs into issues, you would see a larger disparity between these two numbers. Here, you can see the snapshot the types of events that were captured in the respective blocks"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Here is the Total number of DOTs that were issued.

This page shows detailed view of validator and nominator statistics. Here, you can see that the network supports a maximum of 297 active validators and currently it is maxed out. In fact, there are over 617 validators right now that are waiting to become an active validator. Now, the number of nominators supported by polkadot runtime is 22500. Just be aware that these numbers are subject to change through on-chain governance."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Now, although there might be 22500 nominators on-chain, it is not guaranteed that every nominator is rewarded. If the nominator ends up backing a set of validators and none of them make it to the active validator set, the nominator will not earn any rewards in this era (which is one day on Polkadot). The mechanics of nominating and validating are covered in a dedicated video, check it out if you are interested. The inflation rate is adjusted by an equation that is dependent on the ideal staking percentage and currently staked DOTs. This model is subject to change when the parachains are live on the network.\nIf you are a nominator deciding to choose Validators who can be trusted with your stake, then this targets tab can be very resourceful if you. By default, the list is sorted in descending order with respect to the expected returns on your nominated DOTs. You can also view the details of nominations under the waiting tab. If any slashes happened during this era, they would show up here. Finally, the individual validator stats can be viewed here."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Alright. Here is where you can explore the important events that are scheduled on the network. For instance, the start of new staking session event, election of new council candidates, start of new referendum voting period etc. Hope you got an intuition of what can be explored on the network using Polkadot JS Apps. If you would like to explore other networks on the polkadot ecosystem, you can switch to the respective network and start exploring!"))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
